# AI Agent Assist (CODEBREAK 2.0 Hackathon Entry)

## Project Description

This project is an entry for the CODEBREAK 2.0 hackathon, focused on building an AI-powered assistant to significantly improve the workflow and effectiveness of customer service agents. In a demanding environment characterized by high volume, repetitive inquiries, and the need for rapid, context-aware responses across multiple channels, agents often face burnout and operational inefficiencies. This application aims to alleviate these challenges by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to augment human capabilities.

## The Challenge

Customer support agents handle high volumes of repetitive inquiries, require frequent context-switching, and must deliver fast, accurate, and personalized responses across multiple channels. Much of their time is spent manually searching documentation, summarizing tickets, and crafting replies, often under stressful conditions. This leads to burnout, inconsistent customer experiences, and missed opportunities for operational efficiency.

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to develop an AI-powered assistant that will:

* Boost agent productivity.
* Reduce cognitive load on agents.
* Enhance overall customer satisfaction.

## Core Features

The application aims to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for customer service agents, categorized as follows:

1.  **Ticket Management:** Centralized system for handling customer inquiries (creation, assignment, status, prioritization, merging, tagging, SLA tracking, escalation, archiving).
2.  **Customer Information Management (CRM Lite):** Basic customer profiles with contact details, history, and relevant notes.
3.  **Communication Tool Features:** Integrated tools for managing email replies, logging calls, using canned responses/templates, and internal team collaboration.
4.  **Knowledge Management:** An integrated knowledge base with search and article linking, plus suggestion of relevant articles via AI.
5.  **Agent Workflow & Productivity:** Features focusing on UI/UX, performance, notifications, bulk actions, and search to streamline agent tasks.
6.  **Reporting & Analytics:** Basic dashboards for tracking key metrics like ticket volume, resolution times, and customer satisfaction.
7.  **General User Interface / User Experience (UX) Qualities:** Ensuring a consistent, accessible, responsive, and intuitive design throughout the application.

## Tech Stack

Our hackathon entry utilizes the following technologies:

* **Frontend:** React (via Next.js)
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
* **Database:** Supabase (Planned for later integration)
* **Deployment:** Heroku (Planned for later integration)
* **LLM:** Google Gemini AI
* **CPaaS Integration:** Communication Platform as a Service (e.g., Twilio) (Planned for later integration)

## Implementation Flow (Hackathon MVP Focus)

For the hackathon Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we are focusing on building out the core UI and demonstrating the potential integrations using simplified data sources.

1.  **Current UI Development:** The initial focus is on building the user interface (UI) using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The dashboard and individual feature pages (Ticket Management, Customer Info, etc.) are being laid out with placeholder components.
2.  **Simulated Data:** Instead of integrating with live databases or external services initially, components will use hardcoded array data or simple state management to simulate the presence of tickets, customer profiles, etc.
3.  **Simulated LLM Interaction:** LLM (Gemini) functionality, such as summarization or response suggestions, will initially be demonstrated by feeding hardcoded input text to the Gemini API and displaying the output. This allows us to showcase the AI features without needing real-time transcription integrated yet.
4.  **Simulated Interaction Flow:** User actions (e.g., clicking a "Create Ticket" button, viewing a "ticket detail" page) will initially manipulate the hardcoded data or navigate between placeholder pages to simulate the application flow.

**Planned Implementation Flow (Post-MVP / Future Development):**

After the core UI and simulated features are in place, the next steps involve integrating the full stack components:

1.  **CPaaS Integration:** Configure the CPaaS (e.g., Twilio) to route incoming interactions (calls, chats) to our application via webhooks. The CPaaS will handle the initial telephony and potentially provide transcription.
2.  **Backend Processing (Next.js on Heroku):** Our Next.js application, running on a persistent server via Heroku, will receive webhooks from the CPaaS containing interaction data (call events, transcription text).
3.  **LLM Integration (Gemini):** The backend will send relevant text data (transcriptions, customer inquiries) to the Gemini API for processing (summarization, sentiment analysis, knowledge base suggestions, response drafts).
4.  **Database Persistence (Supabase):** Processed data (transcripts, summaries, notes, ticket status updates, customer info) will be stored and retrieved from the Supabase PostgreSQL database.
5.  **Real-time Updates (WebSockets):** The Next.js application (potentially using a custom server or library) will act as a WebSocket server to push real-time data (streaming transcription, live suggestions, notifications) from the backend to the agent's browser.
6.  **Comprehensive UI:** The frontend will display the real-time data from the WebSocket server and persistent data from Supabase, providing the agent with a unified, dynamic interface.

## Setup and Running Locally

Refer to the `SETUP_GUIDE.md` (or the relevant section in this README if combined) for detailed instructions on setting up the Next.js, Tailwind, Supabase, and Gemini components locally.

To run the application locally:

```bash
cd my-agent-assist # Navigate to the project directory
npm run dev       # Start the Next.js development server
# or yarn dev
# or pnpm dev
